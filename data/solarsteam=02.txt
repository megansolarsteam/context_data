SolarSteamâ€™s system uses enclosed solar collectors to concentrate sunlight in order to
generate hot water and steam. The system will operate in conjunction with existing boilers
and use boiler feed water to provide direct hot water and steam generation. SolarSteam
systems reduce costs up to 40% by displacing fossil fuels and GHGs by up to 50%
compared to conventional powered heat generation.
